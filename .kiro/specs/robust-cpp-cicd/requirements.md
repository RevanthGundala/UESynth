# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that ensures code quality and prevents breakage for both the Python client and C++ Unreal Engine plugin components of UESynth. The current CI/CD setup only validates Python code, leaving the C++ plugin vulnerable to build failures and lacking proper testing coverage. This enhancement will add automated C++ compilation validation, comprehensive testing for both components, and cross-platform build verification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and validate the C++ UE plugin, so that I can catch compilation errors before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the CI system SHALL attempt to build the UESynth C++ plugin using Unreal Engine build tools
2. WHEN the C++ plugin fails to compile THEN the CI system SHALL fail the build and report specific compilation errors
3. WHEN the C++ plugin compiles successfully THEN the CI system SHALL proceed to run additional validation steps
4. IF the build environment lacks required dependencies THEN the CI system SHALL install or configure necessary UE build tools and dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive automated testing for the C++ plugin code, so that I can ensure functionality works correctly across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN C++ code changes are made THEN the CI system SHALL run automated unit tests for C++ components
2. WHEN gRPC service implementations are modified THEN the CI system SHALL run integration tests validating service functionality
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the CI system SHALL report detailed test results and failure reasons
4. IF no C++ tests exist THEN the CI system SHALL create a framework for adding C++ tests using Unreal Engine's testing infrastructure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to validate cross-platform compatibility, so that the plugin works reliably across different operating systems and UE versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN the CI system SHALL build the plugin on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)
2. WHEN building on different platforms THEN the CI system SHALL use appropriate UE versions and build configurations
3. WHEN platform-specific build failures occur THEN the CI system SHALL clearly identify which platform failed and why
4. IF a platform build succeeds THEN the CI system SHALL run platform-specific validation tests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to validate the integration between Python client and C++ plugin, so that I can ensure end-to-end functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both Python and C++ components are modified THEN the CI system SHALL run integration tests validating their communication
2. WHEN gRPC protocol changes are made THEN the CI system SHALL verify that both client and server implementations remain compatible
3. WHEN integration tests fail THEN the CI system SHALL provide detailed logs showing the communication breakdown
4. IF the plugin is successfully built THEN the CI system SHALL test basic client-server communication scenarios

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality checks for C++ code similar to the existing Python checks, so that I can maintain consistent code standards across the entire codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN C++ code is modified THEN the CI system SHALL run static analysis tools to check for code quality issues
2. WHEN C++ formatting violations are detected THEN the CI system SHALL report formatting inconsistencies
3. WHEN C++ code contains potential bugs or security issues THEN the CI system SHALL flag these issues and fail the build
4. IF C++ code passes all quality checks THEN the CI system SHALL proceed with build validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to be efficient and provide fast feedback, so that I can iterate quickly without waiting for long build times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI builds are triggered THEN the system SHALL use caching strategies to minimize build times
2. WHEN only Python code changes THEN the system SHALL skip unnecessary C++ build steps
3. WHEN only C++ code changes THEN the system SHALL skip unnecessary Python validation steps
4. IF builds consistently take longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide build time analytics and optimization suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and local development tools that mirror the CI/CD pipeline, so that I can run the same checks locally before pushing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers want to run local checks THEN they SHALL have access to scripts that mirror CI/CD validation steps
2. WHEN local C++ build checks are run THEN they SHALL use the same build configuration as the CI system
3. WHEN local checks pass THEN developers SHALL have confidence that CI builds will also pass
4. IF local environment setup is required THEN clear documentation SHALL guide developers through the setup process
